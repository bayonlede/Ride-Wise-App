With over 200,000 customers and 800,000 monthly trips across major cities, RideWise faces a **25% quarterly churn challenge** that impacts revenue and growth.  \n","\n","The project integrates **customer segmentation, churn modeling, and real-time analytics** to deliver proactive retention strategies. Using Python, scikit-learn, FastAPI, and Streamlit, the solution provides:\n","\n","- **Churn Prediction**: Identifying at-risk users before they leave.  \n","- **Customer Segmentation**: Tailoring retention strategies for commuters, occasional users, and weekend riders.  \n","- **Real-time Insights**: API-driven risk scoring and dashboards for instant decision-making.  \n","\n","This notebook serves as the foundation for exploring the datasets, implementing machine learning models, and demonstrating how data-driven insights can reduce churn, increase customer lifetime value, and optimize marketing
